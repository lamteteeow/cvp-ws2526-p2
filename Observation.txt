- gemini-2.5-flash-image works best with up to 3 images as input, while gemini-3-pro-image-preview supports 5 images with high fidelity, and up to 14 images in total.

    1. Did not work at the beginning in Gemini web app, with biases it worked (even though in a separate thread, they shared information)

    3. Activated thinking mode with 1024 and still did not work.
